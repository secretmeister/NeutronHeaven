# LycheeTweaker

LycheeTweaker is a simple library written for CraftTweaker that adds support for the Lychee mod. Scripts will **ONLY** work on Minecraft version **1.18.2** for **Forge**. Scripts *should* work on Fabric but anything labeled "Forge Only" in the Lychee docs will most likely not work here.

It's highly recommended you use this library in tandem with the official [Lychee Documentation](https://lycheetweaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

If you're having issues, make sure you're on the latest version of CraftTweaker. If you're still having issues, contact **Petey#7443** on Discord (Preferrebly in either the [Minecraft Pack Development](https://discord.gg/28W6cQH) discord or in the [BlameJared/CraftTweaker](https://discord.com/invite/cFCBHn8FjE) discord).

## How to Install/Use

Unzip the file and drag the folder into your `scripts` folder in your Minecraft instance. That's it. Once you've done that make sure to either restart the game or type `/reload` to apply new script changes.
Files should be *mostly* documented, if you need extra assistance look at the `examples.zs` file.
